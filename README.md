# Starting-Machine-learning
Using libraries Matplotlib and Numpy to retrieve and  graph a plot between any two columns of a database given as a .csv file. 
# What this program does
This project selects the desired data from the given .csv file and process this data to plot the graph between two selected columns of the database using python libraries "Numpy" and "Matplotlib".
# Requirements
* Python3 needs to be installed properly. 
* Numpy-'pip install numpy'
* Matplotlib-'pip install Matplotlib'
# Running
'python3 ML1.py'
